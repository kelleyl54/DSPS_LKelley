Review:

Hi Liam,

This plot is overall a great plot. I like the layout of it at first sight. Both the x and y axises are clearly labeled. Colors are are chosen appropriately and the legend is at the right position. I just have a few suggestions about lines:

- The line styles for averages are very similiar, I didnâ€™t notice the difference without seeing the legend carefully;

- The two perpendicular average lines make the viewers feel like the figure is divided into four parts, this is not the information you want to deliver I guess; 

- There seems a linear relationship between yards and points, try a linear fit?

At last, the caption and analysis are also great, and I like the idea that to compare the effect of rule changes on performances by creating a plot like that.
